                Once we inspect your device and verify its condition, there will be nothing more you need to do. If the condition doesn’t match, a new trade-in value will be provided. You’ll have the option to either accept this revised value or reject it. We’ll work with you to confirm that you still want to move forward with the trade-in.
                
                You can also exchange your device at an Apple Store at the point of purchase, however the trade-in value in store may be different from the estimated trade-in value you received online.</div>
